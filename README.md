I'm a 'Jill' of alll trades, master of none - the perfect AI Generalist!

I've decided to do what unqualified generalist do well ... and ... solve problems using A.I. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... a few personal projects, my passions, my help 'make the world a better place' nda-type project for now - but check back soon, it will be open source!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... everything! For now i'm mostly focused on becoming a Expert Generalist, enrolled in Certifications from Google, IBM and Microsoft become a master of some. I'm have been a student enrolled in a few Udemy Courses before my Generalist aspirations began..basic beginner courses - full stack web development, ui/ux design, game development, digital marketing, 3d character design in Blender and cybersecuritybut i think i might be addicted to know more- learn by doing, building (hands on coding) applications. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with anyone, on anything that aligns with my vision and mission 
- (if anyone feels i'm someone whom you want to collaborate with, i'll always be willing and open to!)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Cybersecurity, Web 3/ blockchain engineering frameworks, User verification, App development (android & ios) ... scalling once my mvp is ready to grow.....baby steps for now tho!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... anything.

- âš¡ Fun fact: ... I'm a articulate problem solver using my "undiagnosed (lol) Aspergers - high functioning autism and ADHD with RSD"  super powers, trying to at least build something meaningfull. I strive to 'be better' , learn something new everyday, with a clear mission, trying to change the world!! ...even if its just one persons world... then i know i made a difference.
